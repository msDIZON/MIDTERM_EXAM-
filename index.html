                        <p class="description">The windmills of Ilocos Norte, 
                            particularly in Bangui, are giant structures lined 
                            up along the shoreline facing the West Philippine 
                            Sea. They were built to harness wind energy, making 
                            them the first power-generating windmills in Southeast 
                            Asia. The sight of the tall white turbines against 
                            the sea and mountains has also become a popular tourist 
                            attraction. Aside from providing renewable energy, the
                            windmills symbolize innovation and sustainability in 
                            the province.</p>
